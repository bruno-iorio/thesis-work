      abstract = {The clues for eliciting emotion deserve attention in the realm of Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC). In an ideal dialog system, comprehending emotions alone is insufficient, and underlying the causes of emotion is also imperative. However, previous research overlooked the integration of causal emotion entailment for a prolonged period. Therefore, an emotion-cause hybrid framework that utilizes causal emotion entailment (CEE) is proposed to promote the ERC task. Specifically, the presented method integrates the information of the cause clause extracted through the CEE module that triggers emotions into the utterance representations obtained by the ERC model. Moreover, a Bidirectional Reasoning Network (BRN) is designed to extract emotional cues to simulate human complex emotional cognitive behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, indicating that the proposed framework can improve the model’s ability to emotion understanding.}

    abstract = "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is a field that aims to classify the emotion of each utterance within conversational contexts. This presents significant challenges, particularly in handling emotional ambiguity across various speakers and contextual factors. Existing ERC approaches have primarily focused on modeling conversational contexts while incorporating only superficial speaker attributes such as names, memories, and interactions. Recent works introduce personality as an essential deep speaker factor for emotion recognition, but relies on static personality, overlooking dynamic variability during conversations. Advances in personality psychology conceptualize personality as dynamic, proposing that personality states can change across situations. In this paper, we introduce ERC-DP, a novel model considering the dynamic personality of speakers during conversations. ERC-DP accounts for past utterances from the same speaker as situation impacting dynamic personality. It combines personality modeling with prompt design and fine-grained classification modules. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, ERC-DP demonstrates superior performance on three benchmark conversational datasets."
