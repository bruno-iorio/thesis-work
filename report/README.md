For now, there are 3 models: SimpleModel, SimpleModel1, and SimpleModel2

- SimpleModel: This was the first attempt that was not working well with updatable weigths, so I suggest to ignore this one right now.

- SimpleModel1: This makes more sense, and trains properly. I avoided adding any kind of weight modification, so I could think about it later 

- SimpleModel2: I changed absolutely the preprocessing, and added different loss functions. They both behave very differently upon training.
