### This folder contains the files dedicated to the report of the project. It was taken from ```smover/bt_template``` git page. It is the mandatory template format for this thesis.

Plan detaill√©:

1) Introduction
    1) Introduce some definitions - what is emotion - what is emotion recognition
    2) Narrow down emotion recognition to Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC), and exemplify uses in real life
    3) Explain about Emotion flow, and how we plan to use it in our advantage in this model
    4) Conclude introduction with Hypothesis of the project
    5) Contributions / maybe merge this with the hypothesis
  (Considering to merge these two (Intro and Related work))

2) Related Work
    1) Explain Different methods
    2) Summarize everything and explain why the related work does not fully answer our question

3) Datasets
    1) Provide a brief explanation of the Datasets (Maybe a small paragraph for each)
    2) Describe what we are looking in the datasets, and why ```EmoryNLP``` is more suitable (bc it is more "extreme")

4) Methodology 
    1) Explain what we want to incorporate in the models (having 2 input and 2 output channels + dealing with the fusion layer)
    2) Describe the main architecture of the Simple Linear model and explain how we expect it to solve our initial problem
    4) Provide a Diagram of the architecture
    5) Describe the attention model 
    6) Provide Diagram
5) Experimental protocol
    1) Describe use of validation, test and training sets
    2) How we evaluate 

5) Results
    1) Huge table with f1 score, mcc with each task and models    
    2) provide diagram for Baseline, Linear and attention models with results
    3) describe briefly what is shown in the diagrams[
    4) Ablation and variations
    

7) Conclusion and Perspectives
    1) around 2 to 3 paragraphs to summarize everything that has been done, including the results.
    2) Identify limitations and possible sugestions

8) Glossary
